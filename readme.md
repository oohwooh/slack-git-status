
## Slack Git Status

Its simple really, all it does it sets your latest git commit to your slack status.

## Motivation

I wanted to show people on slack what i was working on at any moment rather than constantly brigading waywo with updates.

## Installation

Once I fix setup.bat you wont have to add the following extra step, but run setup.bat and then go to the file and add in your slack token.

Also add a :github: emoji or change run.js line 13 to have whatever emoji you want. 

Make sure you change my username (dragonballzeke) to your username in run.js where commented that you should do that. 

## Contributors

Me! And you by doing a pull request :)

1. Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a dick.

   Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

 1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the name.
 1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a dick.
 1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER dick.

2. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work,
share the love. Only a dick would make loads off this work and not buy the original work's
creator(s) a pint.

3. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes
you a DONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself. A non-dick would submit the fix back.
